# DavisGroupMatlab
MATLAB analysis suite for Davis group STM data 

Data analysis tools only, No data files should be included. 

Suggestion for importing into local machine:
1. In your prefered directory, usually documents/MATLAB, create 2 folders: "STM" and "STMdata"
2. Pull all files from here to "STM"
3. Any data files/analysis result should go to "STMdata"
4. Once downloaded, you will need to change the file path in whichever files where path error occurs.
