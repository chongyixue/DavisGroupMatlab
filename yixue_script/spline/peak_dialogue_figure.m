function varargout = peak_dialogue_figure(varargin)
% PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE MATLAB code for peak_dialogue_figure.fig
%      PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE, by itself, creates a new PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE returns the handle to a new PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE('Property','Value',...) creates a new PEAK_DIALOGUE_FIGURE or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before peak_dialogue_figure_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to peak_dialogue_figure_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
